## What’s the Point?

When I first started out programming, I originally thought “Who cares whether or not there’s a space between the plus sign and the variables? What does it matter if my code is properly formatted?”. Particularly when it came to commenting my code, I felt as if following coding standards was a waste of time. However, as I progressed into more advanced programming, I became more and more focused on the readability of my code. Once I realized the importance of clarity and efficiency in coding, I developed my ability to write my code more clearly, but I didn’t follow any specific coding standard.

## Coding Standards Actually Help

It wasn’t until I took my first software engineering class that I really grasped the benefits of coding standards. One of the great new things I discovered in my experience with JavaScript is ESLint, an add-on for IntelliJ IDEA that helps programmers to ensure that their code follows the Air Bnb Style Guide for JavaScript. Like many other Integrated Development Environments (IDE’s), IntelliJ when combined with ESLint enables a programmer to easily spot errors in their code and fix code more efficiently and effectively. ESLint does this by highlighting errors in red and the programmer can then click on those highlights to find more details about the error. Once all the errors are fixed, ESLint then displays a green check mark to notify the user that all problems are corrected. This is one of the things I like about ESLint. I love it when I finally get a green check! 

## The How Versus the What

Using ESLint is helping me to think about how to code not just what to code. The how is just as important as the what. For example, if a programmer writes a really excellent program but doesn’t following coding standards and doesn’t make his or her code readable, then other programmers will have a more difficult time understanding the code and will waste time which could be more effectively used on other tasks. Now, using ESLint does require extra time up-front, since programmers have to enable ESLint in IntelliJ IDEA and must take the time to fix all the errors. However, in the long run this is much more efficient and beneficial for the developer and others who will see the code. The biggest thing I have noticed is how readable my code is now. Because I am following the coding standards, I can understand what is going on in a program more easily and I am alerted by ESLint to any errors I have made. 

## Just Go for It!

So, maybe you’re on the fence with coding standards or are totally against following them. This is my challenge to you – just give it a try. I wasn’t too sure about following coding standards before I began doing it, but now I actually enjoy it and I am starting to realize the benefits. In the long term, coding standards will make you a better programmer and will enable you to be more efficient. That’s the point anyway. As software engineers we want to program efficiently so that we can finish a task and move on to the next one, and coding standards can enable us to do that. So, go for it!
