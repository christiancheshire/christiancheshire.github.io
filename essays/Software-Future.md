Software Engineering - it sounds challenging and maybe a bit foreboding for the average computer science student, especially since when we think of engineering we think of buidling huge, complex things. However, it doesn't have to be that way. In fact, I am looking forward to software engineering because I think it will make me a better programmer and a more well rounded computer scientist.

My biggest interest in software engineering is to learn how to develop better software and ultimately be able to develop programs which will help benefit people in my community and across our nation. I think that technology can be an incredibly powerful tool for good, if it is used in the right ways and harnessed appropriately. Software engineering will help me to realize my goal of helping others by developing new technologies and new programs which will be able to do amazing things. By expanding my skills as in software engineering, I will be more effective programmer and will be able to make a greater impact on the world around me.

In the long term, I aim to use what I learn in software engineering in order to achieve my goal of becoming an officer in the Air Force and serving the nation. Because our world today is so complex, we need computer scientists who can enter a wide variety of technology-related fields and bring new ideas, technologies, and developments into every aspect of society and build a better community for us all. I think that by learning software engineering I will be well on my way to doing just that!
