OnoGrindzManoa is a Meteor application which provides dining information for the University of Hawaii community. Finding food on campus is a significant challenge for students and other members of the UH faculty/staff, especially as there are so many options. OnoGrindzManoa enables users to find places to eat which match their preferences and facilitates a better dining experience for the UH Manoa commmunity. 

This application was developed in Meteor/React/Semantic UI using IntelliJ IDEA. I acted as the project manager for the development of this application and was responsible for establishing and directing team tasks, identifying goals for developmental progress, ensuring goals were met on time, and ensuring overall project completion. In addition, I acted as the official spokesperson and communications manager for the project team, which included presenting our application to software engineers, managing our project homepage, and maintaining our project website. My teammates, Michael Arcangel, Weile Lin, and Derek Nishimoto developed the functions for searching for food vendors, different user login roles, the homepage, and the add/edit vendor functionality. I developed the functionality for diplaying the cards with vendor information, the overall layout of the site (nav bar, icons, primary pages), the database of vendor information, and the page displaying locations of vendors. Additionally, I worked with Michael Arcangel to properly clean-up, comment, and format all code.

This project proved to be a rewarding challenge for me. Previously, most of my projects were done on my own and although I had worked with partners, I had not managed a project team. One of the most important benefits I gained was improving my leadership skills and learning how to work with different people who had diverse ideas and focuses. It also taught me the value of planning and ongoing communication in order to ensure project completion and a successful final product. Overall, this experience enabled me to better prepare myself for future employment in the computer science field and enabled me to improve my leadership and management skills.
