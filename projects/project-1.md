The objective of Pikachu Sprint is for the player to cover a maximum distance and avoid hitting obstacles by jumping over oncoming obstacles. The player's score is counted and displayed in the top right corner. Crashing into an obstacle causes the game to stop and prompts the user to play-again or quit while also displaying the player's final score. 

This game was written in Java using the Eclipse IDE. My teammate, Tallas Goo, created the code for the Pikachu character. This included the animation, crash mechanics, and movement mechanics. I developed source code for randomly generated objects and the hit-boxes which the Pikachu character would attempt to avoid. Together, both of us developed the scrolling animated background, music, score counter, and menu. I also acted as the spokesperson for the project team during our final presentation. 

This project constituted my first experience coding a group project. Previously, all my projects were done on my own. The team dynamic proved to be extremely beneficial for me and taught me how to become a better programmer by listening to my teammate's ideas and suggestions. It also provided me an opportunity to give input on other's coding styles and ideas. Working with a project partner forced me to develop new ways of thinking about my code and work hard to contribute to the team effort. Most of all, I learned how important it is for members of a programming team to communicate clearly and effectively as well as share ideas and brainstorm together.
