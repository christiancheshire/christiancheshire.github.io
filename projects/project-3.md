From February 2015 to January 2016 I was the Cadet Commander of the Civil Air Patrol Encampment for Oregon Wing. The Civil Air Patrol is the official auxiliary branch of the U.S. Air Force and is a volunteer organization which conducts Emergency Services, Aerospace Education, and Cadet Programs. I served as a cadet from 2011-2017, culminating my cadet career as a Cadet Colonel and the Cadet Commander of Encampment. 

Encampment is a week-long event organized by most of the Civil Air Patrol's 50+ wings, which are established along state lines. The purpose of the activity is to provide basic leadership and military-type training to new cadets who have recently entered the program and are seeking to advance as cadets. As Cadet Commander of the Oregon Wing Encampment, I was responsible for the well-being, training, and leadership of over 100 cadets under my command. As Cadet Commander I selected all of my training staff members and then led them in a 6-month planning process which culminated in one week of intense training for Oregon Wing's new cadets.

During the one week of training, I was fully responsible for the entire encampment 24/7. All leadership responsibility rested on me. Discipline, safety, training and every other aspect of the event was on my shoulders. Thankfully, I had excellent staff members under my command who enabled the successful completion of our mission.

Ultimately, from this experience I learned to importance of decisive decision-making, extensive prior planning, and free-flowing comunication. As a leader, I had to make difficult and sometimes unpleasant decisions. However, those decisions are what build character and experience. This leadership challenge built me into an even greater leader and person of strong moral character. In the long-term, this experience placed me on my current path to become and Air Force officer and continue to serve my country as a leader in the future.
